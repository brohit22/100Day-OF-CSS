### 100 DAYS OF CSS CHALLENGE

# What is this?

For 100 consecutive days, I've written HTML and CSS snippets as a creative learning process for myself.

I used [CodePen]() to write and save my code and published my results every day on this website.ðŸš€

After accomplishing my project on day 100, I've rewritten the website to let everyone else also [join my challenge](https://100dayscss.com/)
